# neural-signal-processing
 
Coursework for Neural Signal Processing course in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. Focused on the fundamental properties of electrical activity in neurons by analyzing spiking statistics using Poisson processes. Constructed generative models and performed classification, Kalman filtering, principal component analysis and expectation maximization on simulated and real macaque neural data.
